StateEntity
A StateEntity should be able to retain its name. To this end, testName asserts that when setting a name, that name is preserved.
A StateEntity should also retain a description. 'testDescription' works in the same way as testName
A StateEntity should be an instance of an accept state or not. This should be decided on creation, and thus the constructor is a good place to set this value. testAcceptState tests that a StateEntity will remember whether it is an accept state, or not.
A StateEntity should record it's possible transitions. To test this, a transition is added, and then asserted to be present on the StateEntity. This provides that StateEntity objects track their transitions.
A StateEntity should not allow duplicate transitions. To test this, two transitions which are equivalent are created, and added to a StateEntity. The StateEntity is asserted to deny adding the second, equivalent transition.

TransitionEntity
The TransitionEntity should record it's next state. testNext sets a next state, and asserts that it is remembered.
TransitionEntity objects should also record their previous state. testPrev works in the same way as testNext
A TransitionEntity should remember it's input in a similar way. testInput works in this same way.
Finally, TransitionEntity instances should remember its action. testAction works in this same way.

In each of the above cases, the oracle is expected value placed in each test method.

These classes are stubs, as per the deliverable. Their tests, therefore, are also not complete.
